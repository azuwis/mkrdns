# mkrdns - Make Reverse DNS - Version 3.3
#
# By: Theo Van Dinter (felicity@mkrdns.org) (c) 1998-2002
# Revision Info: $Id: mkrdns,v 1.59 2002/12/05 21:19:28 felicity Stab $
#
# The goal of this script is to automatically generate new reverse IP
# mapping zone files for DNS/BIND.  It's been done before, but there
# always seems to be something which makes it not workable in my
# environment.  This script fixes that problem by adapting as necessary.
#
# Feel free to subscribe to the mkrdns mailing list.  Instructions are
# available from the mkrdns web page: http://www.mkrdns.org/ The list is
# available to discuss mkrdns-related topics (mkrdns, DNS, etc.) and is
# also used to announce new versions of mkrdns.

=head1 NAME

mkrdns - MaKe Reverse DNS (auto generate PTR maps)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

mkrdns [options] [configuration file]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

mkrdns is a program designed to auto-generate reverse DNS maps (IN PTR
records).  Some programs already accompany the BIND source package
that will do this kind of thing on a single domain or network basis.
mkrdns will read either a named.boot or named.conf file, figure out
which domains and networks to deal with, and then generate the reverse
maps.

You are deemed "in charge" of a network/domain if you are the primary
DNS for a reverse zone, or if you are either the primary or secondary
for a forward zone.  The exception to this rule is that the 127.*
network is not auto-generated due to the "1 IN PTR localhost." issue.

=head1 OPTIONS

-debug           Print debugging information.  (this will
                 print a B<LOT> of information, be warned.)

-extension <ext> Append the given extension to the output
                 files.  This is useful if you want to
                 have the reverse maps generated, but want
                 to check their contents before use.

-help            The help screen.

-quiet           Turn off warning messages (multiple A
                 records -> IP, etc.)  Good for scripts,
                 but you probably want to check on what
                 the warnings report. 

-rootdir <path>  Specify the path to the root directory
                 that named will be running in.  This
                 will handle anyone using a chrooted
                 environment for named.  Everything except
                 the configuration file is assumed to be
                 under the new root.

-version         Show mkrdns version information.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

mkrdns reads the standard BIND configuration files I<named.boot> and
I<named.conf>.  If you don't specify the full path to the file on the
command line, mkrdns assumes that one (or both) will exist in /etc and
will search for them.  If none are found, the program exits.  If one
is found, it is used.  If both are found, named.conf is used.

=head1 DIRECTIVES

Think of directives as configuration options for mkrdns which are simply
comments to BIND.  The current directives are B<map>, B<serialt>, B<skip>,
and B<skipzone>.

B<Map> allows you to map hosts to another network.  This was designed in
for the purpose of handling DNS for a subnet of a class C network which
you do not control.  (See the DNS & BIND O'Reilly and Associates book,
3rd Ed., pg. 215-218) Assume that you have 10.4.4.32/27 (ie: you have
the 32 IPs from 10.4.4.32 to 10.4.4.63 ...)  You want to do reverse
mappings for those IPs, but you don't control 4.4.10.in-addr.arpa.
How do you do it?  The solution is to become the master for another
zone (such as 32.4.4.10.in-addr.arpa. or 32-63.4.4.10.in-addr.arpa.),
and CNAME the correct reverse pointers to the ones you're in charge of.
The format for the directive is:
   map <network/mask> <new network>

Ex: map 10.4.4.32/27 10.4.4.32-63

This maps all hosts between 10.4.4.32 and 10.4.4.63 to 10.4.4.32-63.32
to 10.4.4.32-63.63.

B<Serialt> will change mkrdns's behavior with the serial number for
certain zones.	By default, the serial number is assumed to be in I<date>
format (YYYYMMDDVV, year/month/day/version).  However, you can tell mkrdns
to treat the serial number as a regular number instead.  This allows
for more than 100 zone changes a day, and has a bit more flexibility
depending on the environment.  The format for the directive is:
	serialt <view> <zone> <format>

<view> specifies which view should be used for the behavior change.
If not specified, mkrdns assumes "default".  <zone> is either "default"
or the actual zone (ie: 0.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa).  <format> is either
"date" or "number".

Ex: serialt internal 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa number

B<Skip> forces mkrdns to ignore certain hosts/IPs via regular
expression. The concept is that there are some IN A records that
you would like to skip and not create a reverse entry.  Skip allows
this. (for instance, "foo IN A 10.4.4.32" and "mail IN A 10.4.4.32" both
exist, but you want to force foo as the reverse lookup and ignore mail.
The following example can do this for you.)  Format:
   skip <regular expression>

Ex: skip ^mail

This will skip any host (or IP) that matches the "^mail" regular
expression.  The host is the FQDN, and the IP is before mapping (see
above).

B<Skipzone> forces mkrdns to ignore certain zones while processing the
named configuration file.  A possible use for this is where you have
"bar.com" and "bar.net", and both of them should have the same host info
(ie: foo.bar.com and foo.bar.net both have the same records.)  You want
"bar.com" to be the reverse lookup for the IPs used.  So set the zone file
setting to the same file (bar.zone), and then add "skipzone bar.net".
B<NOTE:>  The skipzone argument must match EXACTLY with the zone name
in the config file.  B<NOTE:> You can specify multiple zones in the same
"skipzone" statement. (ie: "skipzone foo.com bar.com")  B<NOTE2:> If you are
using views, the zone string must be in the format "view:zone".  If a view
isn't given, "default" is assumed.

B<ignoreslaves> tells mkrdns to ignore any forward slave domains in
the configuration.  This is useful if, for instance, you are master for
both a forward domain and reverse domain (say 168.192.in-addr.arpa)
which go together, but you also have slave domains with hosts in the
same reverse zone.


The format of a directive differs (sorry) between named.conf and
named.boot.  UNIX-style comments (the hash mark then the comment) are
allowed.

=head2 named.boot directives

Directives look like a comment, so the format is simply:

 ; mkrdns <directive type> <parameters>

=head2 named.conf directives

To make directives more efficient with BIND 8, the format is slightly
different: 

 /* mkrdns
    <directive type> <parameters>
    ...
 */

=head1 EXAMPLES

B<mkrdns -e new /etc/named.boot>

This will run mkrdns over the file /etc/named.boot.  Output files will
be generated as <name>.new (i.e.: if the PTR zone file is called
160.zone, the output will be 160.zone.new.)

=head1 NOTES

I tend to use this script like a lint check.  i.e.: Edit the proper
zone files, then run mkrdns.

As with most documentation, there are probably things that aren't mentioned
in the docs that the script does/assumes/etc.  I apologize for any
inaccuracies/omissions.  Let me know if there are any parts that have an
"issue", and I'll see if I can't straighten it out.

=head1 ASSUMPTIONS

The <network>.zone reverse map files must already be created, be
uniquely specified in the configuration file, and have the appropriate
information (SOA/NS records, etc.) in there.  This script will strip
out any PTR records, and then add them back in.  (This means anything
like blank lines and comments will be moved to the top of the file.)
$ORIGIN and $INCLUDE are striped as of mkrdns 1.3.

You must be at least a secondary for all domains which reference IP
networks for which you're responsible.  There is no means (currently
at least) to specify a PTR record for a non-existent A record, so this
script must have access to all A records that need to be "reversed".

If you have more than 1 A record pointing to a specific IP, you can't
have both be the PTR record.  This script takes the first A record it
sees as the one used for the PTR record.  A warning is printed for any
additional entries.  (While the RFCs don't prohibit multiple PTR records
for the same IP, I have yet to find anyone who can give me a good reason
to do it.)

Map serial numbers default to be in YYYYMMDDVV format.  (YYYY = year,
MM = month, DD = day, VV = version (00-99).  This script will convert
your serial number to this format if it's not already.  I don't have too
many daily DNS changes, so the action for not being able to update the
serial number (ie: VV is at 99 and can't be increased) is to simply exit.
If this is going to cause a problem for you, you can use the serialt
directive to specify a zone (or the default) should treat the serial
number as a number instead of using the date format.  Either way,
a problem will come up when the serial number reaches 4294967295 (max
value), but that's another story.  (mkrdns will print a warning if this
is about to happen)
